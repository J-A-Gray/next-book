# NextBook

NextBook finds readers something new to read based on books they've previously loved or hated. Users can also search through NextBook’s entire catalog, built using book metadata from Goodreads. Registered users of NextBook can modify past ratings and receive recommendations based on their entire rating history, while guest users can get recommendations based on as little as one rated book. NextBook’s custom algorithm, built in Python with the Surprise scikit, suggests five books the user may like. The app uses the Google Books API and the Open Library API to enhance the display of results. Users can also locate nearby libraries where recommended books are available using Library.Link.
